📊 Revenue Leakage & Profitability Analysis

Data Analytics Project (SQL + Excel)

🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes transactional sales data to identify revenue leakage, profit-impacting discounts, and category-wise performance for a mid-sized retail business.

The objective is to help business stakeholders understand:

Where profit is being lost

Which categories drive or drain profitability

How discounting affects overall margins

The analysis was performed using SQL (SQLite – web-based) and Microsoft Excel, focusing on practical business insights rather than just queries.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

SQL (SQLite) – data aggregation & metrics generation

Microsoft Excel – pivot tables, KPI calculation, insights

Git & GitHub – version control and deployment

📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

Total Sales

Total Profit

Total Discount

Profit by Product Category

Discount vs Profit impact

Metrics were first computed using SQL and then validated and explored further using Excel pivot tables.

📌 Business Insights

Certain product categories generate high sales but low or negative profit, indicating inefficient discount strategies.

Excessive discounting is a major contributor to revenue leakage.

Some low-volume categories outperform high-volume ones in terms of profitability.

Optimizing discount policies can significantly improve margins without increasing sales volume.

📈 Output Files

Business_Metrics.xlsx
→ Clean metric tables derived from SQL outputs

Business_Insights.xlsx
→ Executive-friendly insights summarizing findings and recommendations

🎯 Why This Project Matters

Simulates a real-world business analytics use case

Focuses on decision-making insights, not just charts

Demonstrates ability to:

Translate raw data into business value

Use SQL + Excel together (industry standard)

Communicate findings clearly
